# Holiday Schedule

CAVEATE for v1: Older project!!! Does not reflect current coding style/conventions!

Have you ever had the issue of figuring out how to schedule the holidays between families and siblings, etc? 
I have. This program helps solve it. The problem i actually quite complex, so there are 3 iterations of it.

Run v3 by `cd v3`, `pip install -e .`, then `python main.py`
